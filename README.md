**Title:** REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING : Walking, Jumping, and Backflips

**Description:**

Welcome to the Humanoid-v4 Mujoco model repository, where you can explore the capabilities of our humanoid agent in the Mujoco physics simulation environment. Our model is designed to showcase dynamic movements such as walking, jumping, and even backflips!

**Features:**

1. **Walking:** Our humanoid agent demonstrates smooth and stable walking locomotion.

2. **Jumping:** With ongoing development, our model is equipped with basic jumping functionality. We are continuously refining the reward function to improve the realism and effectiveness of jumping actions.

3. **Backflips:** Witness the exhilarating acrobatics of our humanoid agent as it attempts backflips! While the code for backflips is implemented, the reward function is still under refinement to enhance the performance and realism of this advanced maneuver.
